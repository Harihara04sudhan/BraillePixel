## 🌐 Next Steps for Netlify Deployment:

### Automatic Deployment:
1. **Netlify should auto-detect the push** and start deploying
2. **Check your Netlify dashboard** at https://app.netlify.com
3. **Monitor the build logs** for any issues

### Expected Build Process:
```
1. Cloning repository ✓
2. Installing Python dependencies ✓  
3. Building static site ✓
4. Deploying functions ✓
5. Publishing to https://pictomoji.netlify.app/ ✓
```

### If Manual Deploy Needed:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site "pictomoji"
3. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Testing:
1. Visit https://pictomoji.netlify.app/
2. Test Braille art with an image
3. Test Emoji art (both text and image modes)
4. Test ASCII text art
5. Verify all features work as expected

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:
- **Build fails**: Check Netlify build logs for Python dependency issues
- **Functions not working**: Verify function files are in correct directory
- **CORS errors**: Functions include proper CORS headers
- **404 errors**: Check redirects in netlify.toml

## 📊 Expected Results:
- ✅ **Build time**: ~2-3 minutes
- ✅ **Functions deployed**: 4 serverless functions
- ✅ **Site live**: https://pictomoji.netlify.app/
- ✅ **All APIs working**: Braille, Emoji, ASCII, Emoji-sets
